## 🚀 Installation & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- GitHub Account

### Local Deployment
bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/oussema-mhiri/final-project.git
cd final-project

# 2. Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Access Application
# Website: http://localhost:8080
# Monitoring: http://localhost:8080/monitoring.html
🔄 CI/CD Pipeline
Pipeline Stages
Code Checkout: GitHub Actions pulls code

Automated Testing: Runs test_site.sh

Docker Build: Builds container image

Deployment Test: Runs container for validation

GitHub Actions Workflow
See: .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml

🐳 Docker Configuration
Dockerfile
dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
Docker Compose
yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    container_name: final-project
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./:/usr/share/nginx/html
📊 Monitoring & Observability
Real-time Dashboard
Access: http://localhost:8080/monitoring.html

Features:

Container metrics (CPU, Memory, Network)

CI/CD pipeline status

System logs with real-time updates

Uptime tracking

Manual refresh controls

Metrics Collection
bash
# Generate metrics report
./collect_metrics.sh
# Output: metrics_report.txt
🧪 Testing Strategy
Automated Tests
File existence validation

Docker configuration checks

HTML structure validation

Required assets verification

Test Script
bash
./tests/test_site.sh
🏆 Project Phases
Phase 1: Installation & Discovery
Selected car rental website

Analyzed code structure

Set up local environment

Phase 2: Containerization
Created Dockerfile for Nginx

Configured docker-compose.yml

Tested container deployment

Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline
Implemented GitHub Actions workflow

Automated testing and Docker builds

Configured deployment validation

Phase 4: Monitoring & Logs
Created monitoring dashboard

Implemented metrics collection

Set up system logging

Phase 5: Documentation
Comprehensive README documentation

Architecture diagrams

Setup instructions

🎓 Learning Outcomes
Technical Skills Acquired
Docker containerization

GitHub Actions CI/CD

Infrastructure as Code

Monitoring and observability

DevOps best practices

Challenges & Solutions
Challenge 1: Docker Desktop GUI Issues
Problem: Docker Desktop showed incomplete container information
Solution: Used CLI commands for accurate verification

Challenge 2: GitHub Actions Permission Denied
Problem: Test script lacked execute permissions in CI/CD
Solution: Added chmod +x command in workflow

Challenge 3: Merge Conflicts
Problem: Git conflicts between local and remote CI/CD configurations
Solution: Used Git conflict resolution strategies

Challenge 4: Empty Monitoring File
Problem: monitoring.html showed white screen (0 bytes)
Solution: Recreated file with proper content and copied to container
